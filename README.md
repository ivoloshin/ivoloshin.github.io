## Welcome to ilyav.net

My name is Ilya and I am an application developer and a .NET technology enthusiast. I am currently employed at [LSI Inc](http://lsijax.com/). but I also do projects on the side for fun or to learn new technologies that will help me at work. When I'm not doing these two things, I'm spending time with my family and friends.
